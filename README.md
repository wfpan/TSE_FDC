# TSE_FDC
This is the replication package for our work submitted to IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering, i.e., Weifeng Pan, Tian Wang, Hua Ming, Dae-Kyoo Kim, Zijiang Yang. XXXX. IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering, 2021, submitted. [[PDF](#)]

# FLSN
This directory contains the FLSN that we built for all the classes in the subject systems. Note that the whole data set will be available after our work's acceptance. Of course, interested readers can email us (Email: wfpan@zjgsu.edu.cn) to get the whole data set in advance. Please use your institutional email address.

# RQs
## RQ1
This directory contains the experiments results that we used for answering RQ1.

## RQ2
This directory contains the experiments results that we used for answering RQ2.

## RQ3
This directory contains the experiments results that we used for answering RQ3.

## RQ4
This directory contains the experiments results that we used for answering RQ4.

# Source Code
This directory contains the scripts to perform all the experiments in our work. It is a small part of our own developped software, SNAP. Of course, the SNAP software can be obtained by emailing us (Email: wfpan@zjgsu.edu.cn).
