This directory contain the scripts to perform the experiments in RQ4, i.e., the code to build the prediction models.

The software, SNAP, used to obtain the FLSNs for classes now is only obtained on request. Interested readers can obtain SNAP by emailing us (Email: wfpan@zjgsu.edu.cn).

Note that this directory now is null. The scripts will be available after our work's acceptance.
